## Fields

### fn new

```ts
new()
```


`azurerm.dev_center_project.new` injects a new `azurerm_dev_center_project` Terraform `resource`
block into the root module document.

Additionally, this inserts a private function into the `_ref` attribute that generates references to attributes of the
resource. For example, if you added a new instance to the root using:

    # arguments omitted for brevity
    azurerm.dev_center_project.new('some_id')

You can get the reference to the `id` field of the created `azurerm.dev_center_project` using the reference:

    $._ref.azurerm_dev_center_project.some_id.get('id')

This is the same as directly entering `"${ azurerm_dev_center_project.some_id.id }"` as the value.

NOTE: if you are chaining multiple resources together in a merge operation, you may not be able to use `super`, `self`,
or `$` to refer to the root object. Instead, make an explicit outer object using `local`.

**Args**:
  - `resourceLabel` (`string`): The name label of the block.
  - `description` (`string`): Set the `description` field on the resulting resource block. When `null`, the `description` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `dev_center_id` (`string`): Set the `dev_center_id` field on the resulting resource block.
  - `location` (`string`): Set the `location` field on the resulting resource block.
  - `maximum_dev_boxes_per_user` (`number`): Set the `maximum_dev_boxes_per_user` field on the resulting resource block. When `null`, the `maximum_dev_boxes_per_user` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `name` (`string`): Set the `name` field on the resulting resource block.
  - `resource_group_name` (`string`): Set the `resource_group_name` field on the resulting resource block.
  - `tags` (`obj`): Set the `tags` field on the resulting resource block. When `null`, the `tags` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `timeouts` (`obj`): Set the `timeouts` field on the resulting resource block. When `null`, the `timeouts` sub block will be omitted from the resulting object. When setting the sub block, it is recommended to construct the object using the [azurerm.dev_center_project.timeouts.new](#fn-timeoutsnew) constructor.

**Returns**:
- A mixin object that injects the new resource into the root Terraform configuration.


### fn newAttrs

```ts
newAttrs()
```


`azurerm.dev_center_project.newAttrs` constructs a new object with attributes and blocks configured for the `dev_center_project`
Terraform resource.

Unlike [azurerm.dev_center_project.new](#fn-new), this function will not inject the `resource`
block into the root Terraform document. Instead, this must be passed in as the `attrs` argument for the
[tf.withResource](https://github.com/tf-libsonnet/core/tree/main/docs#fn-withresource) function to build a complete block.

This is most useful when you need to preprocess the attributes with functions, conditional, or looping logic prior to
injecting into a complete block.

**Args**:
  - `description` (`string`): Set the `description` field on the resulting object. When `null`, the `description` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `dev_center_id` (`string`): Set the `dev_center_id` field on the resulting object.
  - `location` (`string`): Set the `location` field on the resulting object.
  - `maximum_dev_boxes_per_user` (`number`): Set the `maximum_dev_boxes_per_user` field on the resulting object. When `null`, the `maximum_dev_boxes_per_user` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `name` (`string`): Set the `name` field on the resulting object.
  - `resource_group_name` (`string`): Set the `resource_group_name` field on the resulting object.
  - `tags` (`obj`): Set the `tags` field on the resulting object. When `null`, the `tags` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `timeouts` (`obj`): Set the `timeouts` field on the resulting object. When `null`, the `timeouts` sub block will be omitted from the resulting object. When setting the sub block, it is recommended to construct the object using the [azurerm.dev_center_project.timeouts.new](#fn-timeoutsnew) constructor.

**Returns**:
  - An attribute object that can be used with [tf.withResource](https://github.com/tf-libsonnet/core/tree/main/docs#fn-withresource) to construct a new `dev_center_project` resource into the root Terraform configuration.


### fn withDescription

```ts
withDescription()
```

`azurerm.string.withDescription` constructs a mixin object that can be merged into the `string`
Terraform resource block to set or update the description field.



**Args**:
  - `resourceLabel` (`string`): The name label of the block to update.
  - `value` (`string`): The value to set for the `description` field.


### fn withDevCenterId

```ts
withDevCenterId()
```

`azurerm.string.withDevCenterId` constructs a mixin object that can be merged into the `string`
Terraform resource block to set or update the dev_center_id field.



**Args**:
  - `resourceLabel` (`string`): The name label of the block to update.
  - `value` (`string`): The value to set for the `dev_center_id` field.


### fn withLocation

```ts
withLocation()
```

`azurerm.string.withLocation` constructs a mixin object that can be merged into the `string`
Terraform resource block to set or update the location field.



**Args**:
  - `resourceLabel` (`string`): The name label of the block to update.
  - `value` (`string`): The value to set for the `location` field.


### fn withMaximumDevBoxesPerUser

```ts
withMaximumDevBoxesPerUser()
```

`azurerm.number.withMaximumDevBoxesPerUser` constructs a mixin object that can be merged into the `number`
Terraform resource block to set or update the maximum_dev_boxes_per_user field.



**Args**:
  - `resourceLabel` (`string`): The name label of the block to update.
  - `value` (`number`): The value to set for the `maximum_dev_boxes_per_user` field.


### fn withName

```ts
withName()
```

`azurerm.string.withName` constructs a mixin object that can be merged into the `string`
Terraform resource block to set or update the name field.



**Args**:
  - `resourceLabel` (`string`): The name label of the block to update.
  - `value` (`string`): The value to set for the `name` field.

This function will replace the map with the passed in `value`. If you wish to instead merge the
passed in value to the existing map, use the [azurerm.obj.withTimeoutsMixin](TODO) function.

**Args**:
  - `resourceLabel` (`string`): The name label of the block to update.
  - `value` (`obj`): The value to set for the `timeouts` field.


### fn withTimeoutsMixin

```

`azurerm.obj.withTimeoutsMixin` constructs a mixin object that can be merged into the `obj`
Terraform resource block to set or update the timeouts field.
