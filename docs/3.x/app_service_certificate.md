## Fields

### fn new

```ts
new()
```


`azurerm.app_service_certificate.new` injects a new `azurerm_app_service_certificate` Terraform `resource`
block into the root module document.

Additionally, this inserts a private function into the `_ref` attribute that generates references to attributes of the
resource. For example, if you added a new instance to the root using:

    # arguments omitted for brevity
    azurerm.app_service_certificate.new('some_id')

You can get the reference to the `id` field of the created `azurerm.app_service_certificate` using the reference:

    $._ref.azurerm_app_service_certificate.some_id.get('id')

This is the same as directly entering `"${ azurerm_app_service_certificate.some_id.id }"` as the value.

NOTE: if you are chaining multiple resources together in a merge operation, you may not be able to use `super`, `self`,
or `$` to refer to the root object. Instead, make an explicit outer object using `local`.

**Args**:
  - `resourceLabel` (`string`): The name label of the block.
  - `app_service_plan_id` (`string`):  When `null`, the `app_service_plan_id` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `key_vault_secret_id` (`string`):  When `null`, the `key_vault_secret_id` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `location` (`string`): 
  - `name` (`string`): 
  - `password` (`string`):  When `null`, the `password` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `pfx_blob` (`string`):  When `null`, the `pfx_blob` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `resource_group_name` (`string`): 
  - `tags` (`obj`):  When `null`, the `tags` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `timeouts` (`obj`):  When `null`, the `timeouts` sub block will be omitted from the resulting object. When setting the sub block, it is recommended to construct the object using the [azurerm.app_service_certificate.timeouts.new](#fn-timeoutsnew) constructor.

**Returns**:
- A mixin object that injects the new resource into the root Terraform configuration.


### fn newAttrs

```ts
newAttrs()
```


`azurerm.app_service_certificate.newAttrs` constructs a new object with attributes and blocks configured for the `app_service_certificate`
Terraform resource.

Unlike [azurerm.app_service_certificate.new](#fn-new), this function will not inject the `resource`
block into the root Terraform document. Instead, this must be passed in as the `attrs` argument for the
[tf.withResource](https://github.com/tf-libsonnet/core/tree/main/docs#fn-withresource) function to build a complete block.

This is most useful when you need to preprocess the attributes with functions, conditional, or looping logic prior to
injecting into a complete block.

**Args**:
  - `app_service_plan_id` (`string`):  When `null`, the `app_service_plan_id` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `key_vault_secret_id` (`string`):  When `null`, the `key_vault_secret_id` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `location` (`string`): 
  - `name` (`string`): 
  - `password` (`string`):  When `null`, the `password` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `pfx_blob` (`string`):  When `null`, the `pfx_blob` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `resource_group_name` (`string`): 
  - `tags` (`obj`):  When `null`, the `tags` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `timeouts` (`obj`):  When `null`, the `timeouts` sub block will be omitted from the resulting object. When setting the sub block, it is recommended to construct the object using the [azurerm.app_service_certificate.timeouts.new](#fn-timeoutsnew) constructor.

**Returns**:
  - An attribute object that can be used with [tf.withResource](https://github.com/tf-libsonnet/core/tree/main/docs#fn-withresource) to construct a new `app_service_certificate` resource into the root Terraform configuration.


### fn withAppServicePlanId

```ts
withAppServicePlanId()
```

`azurerm.string.withAppServicePlanId` constructs a mixin object that can be merged into the `string`
Terraform resource block to set or update the app_service_plan_id field.



**Args**:
  - `resourceLabel` (`string`): The name label of the block to update.
  - `value` (`string`): The value to set for the `app_service_plan_id` field.


### fn withKeyVaultSecretId

```ts
withKeyVaultSecretId()
```

`azurerm.string.withKeyVaultSecretId` constructs a mixin object that can be merged into the `string`
Terraform resource block to set or update the key_vault_secret_id field.



**Args**:
  - `resourceLabel` (`string`): The name label of the block to update.
  - `value` (`string`): The value to set for the `key_vault_secret_id` field.


### fn withLocation

```ts
withLocation()
```

`azurerm.string.withLocation` constructs a mixin object that can be merged into the `string`
Terraform resource block to set or update the location field.



**Args**:

  - `value` (`string`): The value to set for the `location` field.


### fn withName

```ts

  - `value` (`string`): The value to set for the `name` field.


### fn withPassword
